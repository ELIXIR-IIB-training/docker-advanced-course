# Dockefile from `stdin`

Building an image on the fly, w/o using a static file

```
touch myfile.sh
chmod +x myfile.sh
docker build -t foo . -f-<<EOF
FROM ubuntu:18.04
RUN echo "hello world"
COPY myfile.sh /opt/
EOF
```


# Dockerfile with a remote context

```
docker build -t foo \
       https://github.com/thajeztah/pgadmin4-docker.git \
	   -f-<<EOF
	   FROM ubuntu:18.04
	   WORKDIR /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
	   COPY LICENSE pgadmin4/
	   COPY config_distro.py pgadmin4/
	   EOF
```

# Dockerfile ignore files

Unwanted files can be excluded from the context, by convention
a `.dockerignore` file is required and using regular expression
is possible to exclude files.

# Dockefile ignore files

|Rule|Behavior|
|----|--------|
|#|defines a comment|
|\*/temp\*|Exclude files and directories whose names start with temp in any immediate subdirectory of the root.For example, the plain file `/somedir/temporary.txt` is excluded, as is the directory `/somedir/temp`.|
|\*/\*/temp\*|Exclude files and directories starting with temp from any subdirectory that is two levels below the root. For example, `/somedir/subdir/temporary.txt` is excluded.|
|temp?|Exclude files and directories in the root directory whose names are a one-character extension of temp. For example, `/tempa` and `/tempb` are excluded.|

# Dockefile make it human readble

When possible sorting multi-line arguments is recommended

```
RUN apt-get update &&\
    apt-get install -y \
	    bzr \
		csv \
		git \
		mercurial \
		subversion \
		texlive
```

# Dockerfile quick tips

* Annotate the image with `LABEL`
* Use `ENV` for keeping track of versions
* `COPY` is more transparent than `ADD`
* Use `wget` or `curl` for downloading from the web
* The web does not guarantee URLs forever.
  * Consider to host a web/fileserver for *very imporant* data or software.
  * Licensing can be an issue, some software can not be distributed freely
* Use `WORKDIR` when possible
* Image as executable ? `ENTRYPOINT` is the way to go
  * `CMD` is used for default parameters `--help`
* A regular user with `root` privileges is worst than evil
  * This applies only if it is your infrastrucure :)
  * In most scientific infrastructures Docker is forbidden or masked by some wrapper
